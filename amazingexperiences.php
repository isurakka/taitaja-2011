						<h1 class="contenttitle">Swim with dolphins</h1>

						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Pat a koala</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s wildlife sets it apart from the rest of the planet. Animals such as the kangaroo and the platypus exist nowhere else on earth, and one of the most memorable experiences you can have is to cuddle a koala.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">Go whale watching</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">

						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">See penguins parade</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							An encounter with these captivating sea birds is among Australia’s most thrilling wildlife experiences. Most charming of all are the little or fairy penguins, which stand about 30 centimetres tall and weigh about a kilogram.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Walk near sea lions</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Seals and sea lions thrive in the chilly waters found around Australia’s southern shores, presenting the visitor with an unparalleled wildlife experience.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">Ride a camel</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Tackling Australia’s wild places by camel is in a class of its own, whether the backdrop happens to be a pristine beach or the scorched scenery of the outback.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Fly over Heart Reef</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Located on Hardy Reef, north-east of the Whitsunday Islands, Heart Reef is a microcosm of the astonishing beauty of the Great Barrier Reef.

						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Swim with whale sharks</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia is one of the very few places on earth where you can swim with a whale shark, the largest fish in the sea with a total length approaching 18 metres, yet one that is totally harmless to humans.
