						<h1 class="contenttitle">Outback</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							The outback is a special part of Australia. At the heart of the continent, eons of sun and rain have sculpted an ancient, biblical landscape where the cattle stations are measured in square kilometres and where the land, sky and even the silence exert an almost mystical force.
						</p>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/natureandwildlife1.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Animals and wildlife</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s animals are a breed apart. So strange are the creatures that hop, burrow and slither across its countryside that until the last century it was believed that the continent’s animals had a different evolutionary starting point from the rest of the earth’s species, a separate creation.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Marine and reef</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s vast coastline gives it an unparalleled array of aquatic treasures. As well as the wonders of the world’s longest coral reef, its coast includes spectacular stretches of sea-carved cliffs, sheltered bays where whales give birth, splendid beaches and a wealth of marine life.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Ecotourism</h1>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/natureandwildlife2.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Over the past decade, Australians have become increasingly aware of the value and uniqueness of their natural environment. Ecotourism that focuses on Australia’s pristine rainforests, its marine environment and desert ecosystems has now become a major segment of the country’s tourism industry.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Native flora</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s native plants are among nature’s strangest creations. Botanical oddities are at their most extreme in arid regions, where plants evolved unique characteristics to enable them to survive on the earth’s driest inhabited continent, often acquiring a stark and surreal beauty in the process.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Parks and gardens</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s parks and gardens celebrate the nation’s incredible botanical diversity. As well as plants native to Australia, they have been cultivated with a wide selection of exotics that have been imported from the rest of the world, contributing to a rich palette of forms and colours.
						</p>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/natureandwildlife3.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Rivers and lakes</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s lakes and rivers are a rich repository of wild sensations, from the gushing alpine streams of the Snowy Mountains to the broad, brown rivers of the interior. There are also a few surprises, such as the salt lakes of the outback and the sensational river gorges of Top End Australia.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Mountain and rainforest</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia’s unique plants and animals bring a special touch to its forests and mountains. The chance to explore the rainforests of Queensland with an Aboriginal guide or to spot wallabies grazing in the wildflower meadows of the Snowy Mountains are experiences that will leave you with unforgettable memories.
