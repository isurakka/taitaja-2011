							Step into Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park, a land where imposing russet monoliths loom over flat sand plains, and you step into a world of mystery and legend. This is the home of two of the most breathtaking unique wonders in Australia. Uluru (Ayers Rock), one great monolith rising 348 metres from the earth, and Kata Tjuta (The Olgas), 36 red landforms clustered together just 32 kilometres away. This land is more than a magnificent sight, it is home to the Anangu Aboriginal people.
