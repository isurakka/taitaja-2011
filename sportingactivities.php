						<p class="contenttext">
							Sport is an everyday exhilaration in Australia. Despite the prowess of their athletes, Aussies keep sight of the fact that sport is primarily fun. For every stylish, thoroughbred Melbourne Cup, there's something wacky like the Great Goat Race or the Alice Springs Camel Cup. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Sports galore</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							There are endless sporting opportunities. You can join an annual City to Surf fun run, contemplate the Minolta Australian Ironman Triathlon, or just surf, swim, kick a ball, try indoor rock climbing or swing a golf club. 
						</p>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/sportingactivities1.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Dive in</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia's 36,735-kilometre coastline, bordering two oceans and four seas, is basically one big, long beach - punctuated by spectacular cliffs, headlands, inlets, rivers and waterways. Activities range from swimming, diving and surfing to underwater hockey.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Roaring motors</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia echoes to the sound of high-octane festivals: catch the Telstra Rally Australia in Perth, Honda Indy 300 on the Gold Coast or V8 supercars roaring through Adelaide. Thrill to the Formula One Grand Prix World Championship in Melbourne.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Have a ball!</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							From Evonne Goolagong to Pat Rafter, Australia has spawned more than its share of tennis champions. The Australian Open, at Melbourne Park, is keenly watched and squash, badminton, basketball and netball also have strong followings.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">A passion for fitness</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Get fit! As well as aerobics classes and gyms, Australia offers indoor and outdoor rock climbing, swimming pools galore, some of the world's best walks (try Tasmania), organised fun runs and more golf courses than you can shake a golf club at.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Bounce, kick and throw</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Balls are kicked, thrown and whacked with sticks throughout Australia. The smorgasbord of events spans Aussie Rules (Australia's own fast-scoring brand of football) and the more traditional Rugby, soccer and cricket. Not to mention golf!
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Fishing frenzy</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							A country surrounded by water produces keen fishermen. Angling opportunities extend from Cairns in Queensland's tropical north, to Tasmania's mountain streams and lakes. Fishing charter services, guides and tours help.
