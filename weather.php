							Spending Christmas at the beach or skiing in August may seem strange but Australia's seasons are the opposite of the northern hemisphere - summer officially starts in December and winter in June. But even in winter you'll enjoy blue skies and warm, bright days.

							Australia's climate and the fact that it is the driest continent on earth makes it a fabulous holiday destination all year round, whatever you're planning to do. In the Australian winter you can ski in the southern states one day and be diving in the balmy waters of the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland the next. Such temperate conditions make al fresco dining, sublime days on the beach or the water, outdoor barbeques, and a huge variety of sports a way of life here. No wonder Aussies believe life is for living!
