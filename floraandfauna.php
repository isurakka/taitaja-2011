						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia has around 800 species of bird, 400 of which are unique to this country. The wealth of bird life, from the boisterous laugh of the kookaburra, a large kingfisher, to the brilliantly plumed rainbow lorikeets, makes Australia a haven for bird lovers. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Forests</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							In contrast to the red earth of the outback, Australia is a land of lush green, with forests alone covering five per cent of the landmass. Australia has beautiful and diverse green regions, many located close to major metropolitan areas. The distinctive smell of a eucalypt forest shouldn't be missed!

						<h1 class="contenttitle">Native animals</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							As the Australian landmass separated from the other continents over 50 million years ago, indigenous animals have developed a range of individual and unusual characteristics in a unique habitat. The result is a wealth of wildlife not found anywhere else in the world. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Wildflowers</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							The stunning wildflowers that carpet huge areas of Australia are not to be missed. In Western Australia alone there are over 12,000 species! These beautiful wildflowers have evolved over millions of years due, in part, to Australia's isolation from the rest of the world
