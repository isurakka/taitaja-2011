							Australia excels at exhilaration. Whether your tastes run to riding a Harley into the sunset, soaring into the ether in a jet fighter, skydiving or just meeting a koala at eye-level in a treetop and saying g'day - you'll find exhilaration in Australia! 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">High speed heaven</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							If you thrill to speed, Australia provides plenty of excitement: everything from rocket-like waterskiing, to driving a rally car, to zipping across Sydney Harbour in a jet boat.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Exhilaration in the sky</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Take to the air! Australia's wide-open skies offer plenty of space to parasail over aquamarine seas. Ride a jet fighter, bungee jump, paraglide, skydive or view wildlife from a hot-air balloon. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Breathtaking highs</h1>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/exhilarationactivities1.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia offers dramatic high country to explore by four-wheel drive or mountain bike, ravines to abseil, slopes to ski and some of the world's most extensive cave systems to conquer.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Whitewater euphoria</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Mighty rivers surge throughout Australia, many of them perfect for whitewater rafting. The wild Franklin River in Tasmania and the Tully in Queensland offer adrenaline-laced experiences you won't forget!
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Jump!</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Take the plunge and dive - a 40 second freefall, heart pumping and chute billowing. Parachuting centres and schools offer weekend or week-long skydiving trips close to Australian towns and cities.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Themed adventure</h1>
						<table class="contentimage" align="right"><tr><td><img src="images/thingstodo/exhilarationactivities2.png"/></tr></td></table>
						<p class="contenttext">
							For a lot of exhilaration in one place, try theme parks. The famous Gold Coast attractions are filled with pulse-pounding rides, and Old Sydney Town, where Australia's convict past is recreated daily, is complete with enthusiastic floggings.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Surf's pumping</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia has dominated world surfing for three decades. Spectacular waves at beaches from Surfer's Paradise to Bells Beach can launch you into foam-crested paradise. And there's plenty of moderate waves for learners, too!
