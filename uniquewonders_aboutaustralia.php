						<h1 class="contenttitle">Sydney Harbour Bridge</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Opened in 1932 and affectionately known as the 'coathanger,' the bridge is 1,149 metres long, weighs 52,800 tonnes, has six million rivets and needed 272,000 litres of paint for its initial coat. Paint maintenance is a continual process. It takes 10 years and 30,000 litres of paint before they start all over again!
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Sydney Opera House</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							A short walk from the Harbour Bridge, the Opera House is one of the world's premier performing arts centres. Taking almost 15 years to build, it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">The Blue Mountains</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Dramatic canyons, sheer valleys, thundering waterfalls and gum forests all make up Australia's most recent World Heritage area - the Blue Mountains National Park. Also part of this latest listing is nearby Wollemi National Park - the home of the prehistoric Wollemi Pine.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">The 12 Apostles</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Located along the spectacular Great Ocean Road in Victoria, the 12 Apostles stand as sentinels against a dramatic backdrop of sheer cliff face and wild ocean. Formed over thousands of years by the action of the sea, only eight of the original 12 Apostles remain. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">The Great Barrier Reef</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia's most famous natural wonder, the Great Barrier Reef, will stun you with its magnificence. It's as big as the total combined area of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and contains more than 1,000 islands, from sandy cays to rainforest isles. The beauty of the waters and the prolific life it supports enraptures visitors. You can reach coral sites by air and water taxi and scuba dive or snorkel for intimate reef views. Or choose comfortable accommodation on some secluded reef islands. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Fraser Island</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Stretching 120 kilometres long and 10 kilometres wide, World Heritage listed Fraser Island offers vast white beaches, beautiful headlands and rainforests, and the best camping ever. You can mingle with kangaroos, wallabies and other unique animals, or stay in style at a resort! 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Daintree Rainforest</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Reef and rainforest touch in this region of World Heritage protected beauty. The Daintree River winds gently through tangled woodland through jungle homes of unique birds, pythons and crocodiles, north to Cape Tribulation, a spectacular national park.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">Uluru</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Located in the centre of Australia, Uluru (Ayers Rock) is the world's biggest monolith. It's 3.6 kilometres long, 2 kilometres wide and has a 9.4 kilometre circumference. Made of arkosic sandstone, Uluru changes colour in different lights, particularly at sunrise and sunset. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Kangaroo Island</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Limited development has ensured an abundance of wildlife on this island located close to the tip of South Australia's Fleurieu Peninsula. Here, sea lions, penguins, dolphins, koalas and of course, kangaroos, live in a protected natural environment. Pure air and clean water provide one of the last unspoiled wonders of the world. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Tasmanian Wilderness</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area is one of the largest conservation reserves in Australia, covering 1.38 million hectares. This stronghold of temperate rainforest and alpine vegetation provides pristine habitats for plants and animals found nowhere else in the world, including many rare and endangered species. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Kakadu National Park</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							In Australia's tropical Top End, the delicate pink beauty of the waterlily and the prehistoric brute strength of the crocodile merge in stunning Kakadu National Park. Rivers with roaring waterfalls and a landscape of towering sandstone escarpments cradle some of Kakadu's treasures waiting to be explored.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">Bungle Bungles</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							The Bungle Bungle Range, in Purnululu National Park, is one of the most fascinating geological landmarks in Western Australia. Orange and black stripes of silica and algae across the beehive-like mounds are clearly visible as you approach from the air. Closer up, a hidden world of gorges and pools is revealed, with fan palms clinging precariously to walls and crevices in the rocks.
