						<h1 class="contenttitle">Settlement</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Overcrowded prisons in England and disruption caused by the American Revolution were two key reasons for the first shipment of convicts to the great southern land. It was the explorer and botanist Joseph Banks who, in 1779, suggested that New South Wales would be a fine site for a penal colony!
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Aboriginal history</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							For more than 50,000 thousand years, Australia's Aboriginal people have lived and thrived in Australia's unique and challenging natural environment. Australia's rich vegetation and native wildlife helped them establish their presence on the land. Today it is believed the Aboriginals are the world's oldest civilisation. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Discovery</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							'Terra Australis' was the last landmass to be discovered by European explorers. Talk of this mystical land and the riches it held inspired explorers to sail into the unknown. It wasn't until Captain James Cook arrived in Botany Bay in 1770 that the great southern land was officially discovered by Europeans.

						<h1 class="contenttitle">States and Territories</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia is made up of six states and two territories. Each state and territory has its own parliament, flag and floral emblem. Australia became a federated nation after the union of the six colonies on 1 January 1901. Bound by one parliament, one constitution and one flag, Australia celebrated its Centenary of Federation in 2001.
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Defence</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							Australia's defence force has a long and proud tradition dating back to the original ANZACS (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps). Australian soldiers have fought in both World Wars and numerous allied conflicts. All Australian troops are remembered each year on Anzac Day, 25 April, the anniversary of the first landing of Australian 'Diggers' at Gallipoli during the First World War. 
						</p>
						<h1 class="contenttitle">Exploration</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							It wasn't until the 19th century that serious European exploration of the Australian continent began. These explorers were mainly driven by a desire to discover new grazing land as well as land not claimed by Europeans before. In later years it was gold that drove further exploration.
