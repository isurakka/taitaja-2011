							The Central Eastern Rainforest Reserves of Australia contain more than 50 World Heritage listed national parks and reserves stretching for more than 500 kilometres from New South Wales into Queensland.  Mount Warning, Nightcap and Border Ranges national parks cover some 42,000 hectares. The parks attract eco-travellers from around the world, many coming to conquer the 1,100-metre Mount Warning, a once-active volcano. Once at the peak, you’re rewarded with stunning 360-degree views.
