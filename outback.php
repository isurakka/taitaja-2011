						<h1 class="contenttitle">Remote Kimberley</h1>
						<p class="contenttext">
							The remote Kimberley is one of the world’s last great outback wildernesses, covering 420,000 kilometres. Its vast horizons and ancient gorges are places of immense beauty. One of the most stunning of the Kimberley’s national parks is Purnululu National Park, home to the Bungle Bungle Ranges. These fascinating geological landmarks look like giant beehives, and shelter cool gorges and fan palms. Made mainly from sandstone, ancient weathering has produced beautiful results.
